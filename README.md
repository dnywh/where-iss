# Where ISS

Use your Pi and Waveshare ePaper/e-ink display to track the International Space Station's (ISS) whereabouts.

This was a long journey for me so I've split the repo up into steps for anyone in a similar situation.

- Copy your own Waveshare driver .py file into the lib/waveshare*epd directory. I've used the 7.5" version, hence \_epd7in5_V2.py*.

## Files in more detail

<!-- ### Hello World

## Internet

For all of these (excluding _Hello World_), you need your Wi-Fi credentials. See _secrets.example.py_ for that.

1. Change _secrets.example.py_ to _secrets.py_
2. Fill in your credentials
